# Group Projects Collaboration Space

So this space is primarily to keep any and all projects together preferably ones worked on together but pair programs also work.‚ù§Ô∏è

## Getting Started

To get started with a project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine you can work in the browser if you want but I'd recommend getting vscode with the appropriate extensions as well as github desktop to be able to access and edit this space 

2. **Familiarize Yourself**: Read the project documentation, including the README and any specific project guidelines so that it all looks put together and clean.

3. **Set Up Environment**: If required, set up the project environment ask for help if you don't know how to setup the environment in vscode or whatever editor you plan to use.

4. **Start Contributing**: Select an issue, task or project to work on and start contributing!

## Project Structure

The project follows a defined structure to maintain consistency and organization:

This structure is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project.
- `tests/`: Includes unit and integration tests.
- `docs/`: Holds documentation files.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for users and contributors.

Feel free to suggest modifications to the project structure if needed but I figured we need a structure to start with. All the above will be organised into folders for each project.

## Contributing Guidelines

Please follow guidelines when contributing to the project just so we're all on the same page and it doesn't become difficult to manage üíï:

- **Branching Strategy**: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix,

- **Code Style**: Follow the project's established coding style and conventions. Refer to the project-specific style determined by your partner or the group.

- **Commit Messages**: Use descriptive and concise commit messages,

- **Pull Requests**: Provide a clear description of the changes made and ensure that the pull request passes all checks before merging so that partners or the rest of the group understand what has changed.

## Communication

Effective communication is key to successful collaboration. ü•∞
Use the following channels:

- üíõ **Snapchat**: Use issues to report bugs, propose new features, or discuss project-related matters.

## Application and resources

What applicaitons we'll use and resources to help:
- ‚ö™ Unity
- üîµ VScode
- üî¥ Youtube
## Code Review

Code reviews are crucial for maintaining code quality and ensuring consistency. To facilitate smooth code reviews:

- Ask around the group for help when reviewing, the more eyes the better.
- Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement trying to be as detailed as possible.
- At the end of the day ‚ú®positive feedback‚ú® is what we need since we're all learning and practicing and we all have different strengths and weaknesses

## Testing

Comprehensive testing is essential to ensure the project's reliability and robustness. Write and maintain unit tests, integration tests, and any other relevant tests to validate the functionality of the code. Keeping logs is important to see what has happened and can often help when stuck in a project

## Documentation

Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation throughout the project. Document code, APIs, project structure, setup instructions, and any other relevant information to aid understanding and future development.

## Contributers
